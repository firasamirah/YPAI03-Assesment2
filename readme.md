# Categorize unseen products into 4 categories namely "Electronics”, "Household”, "Books”, and “Clothing & Accessories”.

## Project Description
The action of electronically purchasing or reselling goods using online services via the Internet is known as e-commerce (or electronic commerce). While it may also use other technologies like e-mail, it frequently employs the web, if not totally, for at least some of the life cycle of a transaction. The purchase of goods (like books from Amazon) or services (such music downloads through digital distribution, like the iTunes Store), are examples of common e-commerce transactions. The three components of e-commerce are online retail, electronic markets, and online auctions. Electronic business provides a foundation for e-commerce. E-commerce's goal is to make it possible for customers to make purchases and payments online using the Internet, saving both consumers and businesses space and time while also vastly boosting

The objective of the project is to classify a product into the four categories Electronics, Household, Books and Clothing & Accessories, based on its description available in the e-commerce platform.

This is the classification based E-commerce text dataset for 4 categories - "Electronics", "Household", "Books" and "Clothing & Accessories", which almost cover 80% of any E-commerce website. The dataset is in ".csv" format with two columns - the first column is the class name and the second one is the datapoint of that class. The data point is the product and description from the e-commerce website.
